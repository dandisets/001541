description: Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is a wide-field optical technique
  commonly used to monitor cerebral blood flow (CBF). Recently, we have discovered
  that besides the fast-decorrelating signals from blood flow, LSCI can also detect
  slow-decorrelating signals associated with cellular activity. The ability to image
  these signals has significant implications for various research areas such as ischemic
  stroke, as it enables longitudinal monitoring of both vascular and cellular dynamics,
  offering new biomarkers for tissue viability, injury progression, and therapeutic
  response. Here, we demonstrated that epi-illumination LSCI enables the mapping of
  both slow speckle dynamics (SSD) for evaluating cellular dynamics and traditional
  fast speckle dynamics (FSD) for evaluating CBF. We found that SSD signals are much
  more evident with epi-illumination than with conventional oblique illumination LSCI.
  Using mouse models of ischemic stroke, including both permanent and transient occlusion
  of the distal middle cerebral artery (dMCA), we demonstrated the systemâ€™s ability
  to track stroke progression from minutes to days post-stroke. This study establishes
  a powerful, label-free imaging tool for investigating both cellular and vascular
  health during stroke core evolution.
